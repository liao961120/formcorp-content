<h2>The Frog story</h2>
<p>There are six books from the Mercer Mayer “Frog series”: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140546324/002-7561052-6720039?v=glance">Frog, Where Are You?</a>; Frog goes to Dinner; A Boy, A Dog and A Frog; A Boy, A Dog, A Frog and A Friend; Frog on His Own; and One Frog Too Many.</p>
<p>Dan Slobin of UC Berkeley used Frog, Where Are You? to elicit narratives from speakers of various languages in the description of motion events. The Frog story is about the adventures of a frog that a boy keeps in his jar. One night the frog gets out and leaves the room and the boy wakes up the next morning to find it gone. The boy and his dog then head out to the woods to look for the frog. On the way they first run into a mouse and a beehive on the top of a tree. The dog shakes the tree and the bees turn loose and start chasing the dog. The boy gets to the top of a tree and looks into a hole. An owl emerges from the hole and the boy is scared, falls off the tree, and lands on his back. The boy tries to get away from the owl. He gets on top of a rock. He reaches to grab branches of a tree, which turns out to be the antlers of a deer. The deer rises up, carries the boy on its head, and starts to run toward a cliff. The deer stops at the edge of a cliff, throws off the boy, and he and also the dog fall into a body of water below. The boy and the dog swim to a tree trunk with a hole in it. They peek through the hole and see their frog and a bunch of other frogs together. The boy picks up his frog and heads back home, waving goodbye to the other frong.</p>
<p>In a series of papers Slobin and his associates have shown that the preferred construction type in a languages predisposes speakers of different languages to deal differently with motion events encoded in the construction and that the domain of manner of motion is highly codable in satellite-framed languages ( also called S-languages in the literature) and, therefore, in terms of thinking for speaking, is also more available, in comparison with verb-framed languages (V-languages). The research question then is to identify the ‘preferred construction type’ of each language.</p>

<h2>Introduction to the Pear Stories</h2>
<p>In the mid-1970’s, to test how much a simple story will vary from language to language, Chafe and his research team designed a very simple film to elicit stories from speakers around the world, including uneducated speaker in rural areas. (For full description, see Chafe 1980) Chafe and his team were very generous in sharing the film with the researchers around the world interested in the study.</p>
<p>The Pear Stories’ film starts with a man on a tree picking his pears. A boy rode by on his bike and stole some of the pears.The boy then had a series of adventures with other children.At the end of the film, The farmer then discovers that his pears are missing, but then he sees three boys passing by eating pears. The film is six minutes long, in color, with sound effects but contains no dialogue. It was filmed in northern California, near the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p>To avoid imposing a strong cultural bias, the story line is deliberately loose and bland. The scene of the boy’s falling off the bike and pears spilling to the ground can be used to understand how speakers of different languages encode the concept of cause and effect. And the unusual ping-pong toy tests how people describe or name an unfamiliar object. The final scene of the farmer’s discovery that his pears were stolen re-introduces a character who had been off-scene for most of the film can be used to elicit the description of emotions and state a moral. Also, the short scene of a man walking by the fruit three pulling a goat is inserted into the film to test descriptions of a background event with no later significance.</p>
