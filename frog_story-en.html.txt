<h1>The Frog story</h1>
<p>There are six books from the Mercer Mayer “Frog series”: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140546324/002-7561052-6720039?v=glance">Frog, Where Are You?</a>; Frog goes to Dinner; A Boy, A Dog and A Frog; A Boy, A Dog, A Frog and A Friend; Frog on His Own; and One Frog Too Many.</p>
<p>Dan Slobin of UC Berkeley used Frog, Where Are You? to elicit narratives from speakers of various languages in the description of motion events. The Frog story is about the adventures of a frog that a boy keeps in his jar. One night the frog gets out and leaves the room and the boy wakes up the next morning to find it gone. The boy and his dog then head out to the woods to look for the frog. On the way they first run into a mouse and a beehive on the top of a tree. The dog shakes the tree and the bees turn loose and start chasing the dog. The boy gets to the top of a tree and looks into a hole. An owl emerges from the hole and the boy is scared, falls off the tree, and lands on his back. The boy tries to get away from the owl. He gets on top of a rock. He reaches to grab branches of a tree, which turns out to be the antlers of a deer. The deer rises up, carries the boy on its head, and starts to run toward a cliff. The deer stops at the edge of a cliff, throws off the boy, and he and also the dog fall into a body of water below. The boy and the dog swim to a tree trunk with a hole in it. They peek through the hole and see their frog and a bunch of other frogs together. The boy picks up his frog and heads back home, waving goodbye to the other frong.</p>
<p>In a series of papers Slobin and his associates have shown that the preferred construction type in a languages predisposes speakers of different languages to deal differently with motion events encoded in the construction and that the domain of manner of motion is highly codable in satellite-framed languages ( also called S-languages in the literature) and, therefore, in terms of thinking for speaking, is also more available, in comparison with verb-framed languages (V-languages). The research question then is to identify the ‘preferred construction type’ of each language.</p>
